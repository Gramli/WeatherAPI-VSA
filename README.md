# Vertical Slice Architecture WeatherApi

REST API solution demonstrates how to create API with Vertical Slice Architecture, minimal API and various of design patterns.  

Example API allows to get actual/forecast weather data by location from [Weatherbit](https://www.weatherbit.io/) throught [RapidAPI](https://rapidapi.com) and also allow's to add favorite locations into [in memory database](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/ef/core/providers/in-memory/?tabs=dotnet-core-cli) and then get weather data by stored (favorites) locations.

## Get Started
1. Register on [RapidAPI](https://rapidapi.com)
2. Subscribe Weatherbit (its for free) and go to API Documentation
3. In API documentation copy (from Code Snippet) **X-RapidAPI-Key**, **X-RapidAPI-Host** and put them to appsettings.json file in WeatherAPI project
```json
  "Weatherbit": {
    "BaseUrl": "https://weatherbit-v1-mashape.p.rapidapi.com",
    "XRapidAPIKey": "value from code snippet",
    "XRapidAPIHost": "value from code snippet"
  }
```
4. Run Weather.API 

### Try it using .http file (VS2022)
 * Go to Tests/Debug folder and open **debug-tests.http** file (in VS2022)
 * Send request

## Motivation
Main motivation is to write practical example of simple API using Vertical Slice Architecture and then compare it to same API designed by Clean Architecture.
